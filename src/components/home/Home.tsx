            At Sapphire Palace, we believe that true luxury is more than just
            beautiful interiors and high-quality services. That's why we strive
            to provide our guests with a unique atmosphere that will make them
            feel at home while being able to relax and unwind in style.
            <br /> Our history dates back to the early 20th century when Emilio
            Rizzo, an Italian immigrant and lover of beauty, built Sapphire
            Palace with the aim of creating an exclusive hotel on the
            Mediterranean coast. Since then, the hotel has become a symbol of
            luxury and good taste, attracting rich and influential people from
            all over the world.

            Today, after years of neglect, Sapphire Palace returns as one of the
            most prestigious holiday destinations. By renovating the hotel, we
            have preserved its original character while adapting it to the needs
            of our guests. Our interiors have been designed to provide maximum
            comfort and convenience while maintaining the original classical
            style. At Sapphire Palace, we take care of every detail, starting
            from our restaurant serving exquisite dishes made from the best
            ingredients to our spa offering a wide range of relaxation and
            beauty treatments. Our staff consists of qualified and experienced
            professionals who are always available to assist our guests.
